the formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in years.
Your target heart rate is a range that is 50-85% of your maximum heart rate. Create a class called Rates.
The class attributes should include the person's first name, last name, year of birth and the current year.
Your class should have a constructor that receives this data as parameters. For each attribute provide
a property with set and get accessors. the class also should include a  property that calculates and returns
the person's age (in years), a property that calculates and returns the person's maximum heart rate and properties that
calculate and return the person's minimum and maximum target heart rates.
an app that prompts for the person's information, instantiates an object of class Rates and displays the information
from that object, including the person's first name, last name, and year of birth. then calculates and displays
the person's age in years, maximum heart rate and target-heart-rate range.
